# NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions 2013-2019
This is a breakdown of every collision in NYC by location and injury. This data is collected because the NYC Council passed Local Law #11 in 2011. Each record represents a collision in NYC by city, borough, precinct and cross street. This data can be used by the public to see how dangerous/safe intersections are in NYC. The information is presented in pdf and excel format to allow the casual user to just view the information in the easy to read pdf format or use the excel files to do a more in-depth analysis.
